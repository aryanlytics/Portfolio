# **Muhammad Aryan - Portfolio**

## About
I'm **Muhammad Aryan**, a **data analyst** specializing in **diagnostic analysis** and **business problem-solving** for e-commerce and marketplace operations. I focus on answering the question: "Why is this happening?" rather than just "What happened?"

I use **SQL**, **Python**, and **statistical analysis** to diagnose business problems, distinguish between operational and structural issues, and deliver recommendations that fit real-world constraints. My work emphasizes **business impact over technical complexity**—turning data into decisions that leadership can act on.

Here, you'll find projects that demonstrate **diagnostic thinking**, **hypothesis testing**, and **strategic recommendations** grounded in statistical evidence and business reality.

## **Portfolio Projects**
Here is a brief overview of my projects. Click on the links to see the full project details.

# **Project 1. Olist Marketplace Retention Analysis:**
### **Diagnosing 97% Customer Churn**         

**Overview:**  
Olist, a Brazilian e-commerce marketplace, faced a critical retention problem: 97% of customers never made a second purchase. Leadership needed to know whether this was an operational failure they could fix (delivery speed, seller quality) or a structural market behavior requiring a strategic pivot.

This project diagnoses the root cause using statistical testing to distinguish correlation from causation, examining delivery performance, customer satisfaction, category mix, pricing, and geography.

**Goal:**  
* Determine if retention failure is operational (fixable) or structural (requires strategic change)
* Test hypotheses about delivery, reviews, category, and price effects on retention
* Provide actionable recommendations within Olist's platform constraints (no logistics control)

**Result:**  
Proved that retention is a **structural market problem**, not operational. Even customers with perfect experiences (on-time delivery, 5-star reviews) only returned 3.2% of the time. Statistical tests confirmed delivery (p=0.004) and satisfaction (p=0.889) have minimal impact on retention.

**Key insight:** Olist was positioned as a transactional marketplace for one-off purchases, not a relationship platform. Recommended shifting from retention optimization to acquisition efficiency and category mix improvement—estimated **$2.5M GMV impact over 3 years** without changing logistics or seller infrastructure.

# **Project 2. Instacart Customer Behavior Analysis:**
### **Diagnosing Reorder Patterns and Basket Size Drivers**

**Overview:**  
Instacart operates in a low-margin, high-volume grocery delivery business where two metrics determine profitability: reorder rate (retention) and basket size (revenue per transaction). Across 32.4 million orders, the company noticed wide variation in both—some products reordered at 67%, others at 35%; some baskets with 30+ items, others with just 2-3 items.

This project diagnoses what drives these behaviors using statistical testing (chi-square, ANOVA, correlation, regression) to determine whether differences are operational, behavioral, or timing-based.

**Goal:**  
* Determine why some products get reordered while others don't (category psychology vs operational failure)
* Identify what drives basket size variation (customer loyalty vs shopping breadth)
* Provide data-backed recommendations to optimize retention spend and revenue per order

**Result:**  
**Question 1 (Reorder Behavior):** Proved reorder rates are driven by **category type** (dairy 97% higher odds, pantry 53% lower, p < 0.001) and **user frequency** (45-point spread between new and established customers), not timing. Pantry's low reorder rate reflects natural variety-seeking behavior, not retention failure. Recommended reallocating 15-20% of wasted retention budget from pantry promotions to dairy/beverage reorder campaigns.

**Question 2 (Basket Size):** Proved basket size is driven by **category diversity** (each additional department = +2.43 items, r = 0.82, p < 0.001) and **day of week** (Sunday baskets 19% larger, p < 0.001), not customer frequency. High-loyalty customers (80%+ reorder rate) have 21% *smaller* baskets because they buy the same staples efficiently. Recommended shifting promotional budget to Sundays and building cross-category bundles to drive breadth, not frequency.

**Key insight:** Both metrics are about **what customers buy** (category mix) and **when they shop** (weekly rhythms), not **who they are** (loyalty tier). Instacart was treating basket growth as a loyalty problem when it's actually a cross-selling problem. Expected impact: +$10-15 revenue per order through category expansion, 15-20% promotional ROI improvement by targeting high-basket days.
