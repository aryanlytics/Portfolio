# **Muhammad Aryan - Portfolio**

## About
I'm **Muhammad Aryan**, a **data analyst** specializing in **diagnostic analysis** and **business problem-solving** for e-commerce and marketplace operations. I focus on answering the question: "Why is this happening?" rather than just "What happened?"

I use **SQL**, **Python**, and **statistical analysis** to diagnose business problems, distinguish between operational and structural issues, and deliver recommendations that fit real-world constraints. My work emphasizes **business impact over technical complexity**—turning data into decisions that leadership can act on.

Here, you'll find projects that demonstrate **diagnostic thinking**, **hypothesis testing**, and **strategic recommendations** grounded in statistical evidence and business reality.

## **Portfolio Projects**
Here is a brief overview of my projects. Click on the links to see the full project details.

## **Project 1. Olist Marketplace Retention Analysis: Diagnosing 97% Customer Churn**
**Overview:**  
Olist, a Brazilian e-commerce marketplace, faced a critical retention problem: 97% of customers never made a second purchase. Leadership needed to know whether this was an operational failure they could fix (delivery speed, seller quality) or a structural market behavior requiring a strategic pivot.

This project diagnoses the root cause using statistical testing to distinguish correlation from causation, examining delivery performance, customer satisfaction, category mix, pricing, and geography.

**Goal:**  
* Determine if retention failure is operational (fixable) or structural (requires strategic change)
* Test hypotheses about delivery, reviews, category, and price effects on retention
* Provide actionable recommendations within Olist's platform constraints (no logistics control)

**Result:**  
Proved that retention is a **structural market problem**, not operational. Even customers with perfect experiences (on-time delivery, 5-star reviews) only returned 3.2% of the time. Statistical tests confirmed delivery (p=0.004) and satisfaction (p=0.889) have minimal impact on retention.

**Key insight:** Olist was positioned as a transactional marketplace for one-off purchases, not a relationship platform. Recommended shifting from retention optimization to acquisition efficiency and category mix improvement—estimated **$2.5M GMV impact over 3 years** without changing logistics or seller infrastructure.

*This portfolio demonstrates diagnostic analysis capabilities: distinguishing between what's broken operationally and what requires strategic change. Each project focuses on business decisions, not just technical execution.*
