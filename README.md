# **Muhammad Aryan - Portfolio**

## About Me

I'm **Muhammad Aryan**, a **data analyst** who helps leadership make confident decisions. I turn raw data into clear insights about customer behavior and revenue, so you know what's actually happening, why it's happening, and what the data suggests.

I use **SQL**, **Python**, and **statistical testing** to diagnose business problems across e-commerce, marketplaces, SaaS and financial services. My work focuses on **business impact over technical complexity**—delivering recommendations that fit real-world constraints.

## **Portfolio Projects**

## **Project 1: Olist E-Commerce Retention Analysis**
**Diagnosing Why 97% of Customers Never Returned**

**The Problem:**  
Olist, a Brazilian e-commerce marketplace, faced a 97% customer churn rate. Leadership needed to know whether this was fixable through operational improvements (delivery speed, seller quality) or a structural market behavior requiring strategic change.

**What I Did:**  
- Analyzed 96K customer transactions across delivery performance, reviews, categories, pricing, and geography
- Used statistical testing (chi-square, cohort analysis) to prove causation vs correlation
- Tested whether delivery speed, customer satisfaction, or category mix could fix retention

**What I Found:**  
Even customers with perfect experiences (on-time delivery + 5-star reviews) only returned 3.2% of the time. Statistical tests proved delivery (p=0.004) and satisfaction (p=0.889) have no meaningful impact on retention—the problem is **structural market behavior**, not operations.

**What the Data Suggested:**  
Stop fighting retention with operational fixes. Reallocate retention marketing budget (~$300K annually) to acquisition efficiency and shift category mix toward high-repeat categories like home appliances (11% repeat rate vs 3% average).

**Impact:** Projected $2.5M GMV increase over 3 years without changing logistics or seller infrastructure.

## **Project 2: Instacart Customer Behavior Analysis**
**Understanding Reorder Patterns and Basket Size Drivers**

**The Problem:**  
Instacart needed to understand why reorder rates varied 32 percentage points across categories (dairy 67% vs pantry 35%) and why some customers built large baskets while others didn't.

**What I Did:**  
- Analyzed 32M orders using statistical testing (chi-square, ANOVA, correlation, regression)
- Tested whether reorder behavior was driven by category type, customer loyalty, timing, or product popularity
- Tested whether basket size was driven by customer frequency, shopping breadth, or day of week

**What I Found:**  

**Reorder Behavior:**  
- Category type dominates everything—dairy has 97% higher reorder odds (p < 0.001), pantry has 53% lower odds
- Low pantry reorders aren't a retention problem—customers want variety in pasta/snacks, not brand loyalty
- Customer frequency matters (45-point spread between new and established customers), but category still dominates

**Basket Size:**  
- Category breadth drives basket size—each additional department adds 2.43 items (r = 0.82, p < 0.001)
- Sunday baskets are 19% larger than Wednesday (p < 0.001)—weekly stock-up behavior is real
- High-loyalty customers (80%+ reorder) have 21% smaller baskets—they buy the same staples efficiently

**What the Data Suggested:**  
- Stop wasting retention budget on pantry promotions (save 15-20% of spend)
- Focus retention on dairy/beverages where loyalty exists naturally
- Shift promotional budget to Sundays when customers are stocking up
- Build cross-category bundles to increase basket breadth, not customer frequency

**Impact:** Potential +$10-15 revenue per order through category expansion, 15-20% promotional ROI improvement.
